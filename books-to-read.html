      <p>
        Here you'll find the three books I recommend the most to anyone who
        wants to try creative writing
      </p>
      <p>
        What you won't find here is some get rich quick huckster bull-shit about
        how if you just plot your story this way or that, you'll sell a million
        copies easy. <br>Just the good stuff.

        <h4><em>On Writing</em>- Stephen King</h4>
        <p>
          Stephen King's on writing is part autobiography and part a love letter
          to the craft.

        <p>
          He won't give you incredibly specific advice, but the advice he gives
          is the only good advice that's out there:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Read a lot</li>
          <li>Write a lot</li>
          <li>Give yourself a place to work that doesn't put art before life</li>
          <li>Show up everyday</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><em>Elements of Style</em>- Strunk and Weiss</h4>
        <p>
          You might know the Weiss half from this duo: he's the guy who wrote
          perennial elementary school favorite <u>Charlotte's Web</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          What you might not know is that this style guide is assigned around the
          the USA as one of the textbooks for freshman composition.

        <h4><em>Poetic Meter and Poetic Form</em>- Paul Fussell</h4>
        <p>
          If you ever wanted to pick up on the more technical aspects of poetry,
          Fussell's book and a good anthology is all you'll need.

        <p>
          Even if you don't plan on writing any poetry yourself, readint his book
          could give you some great insight into how to include rhythm in your
          prose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that some of the greatest novels ever written were really just
          prose poems!
